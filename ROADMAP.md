## Future Roadmap

### ✅ Sprint 8 — CLI & Real Repository Scanning

- [x] Packaged with branding, inputs (max-files, ignore), and outputs in `action.yml`.
- [x] Added automated integration tests under `tests/action-integration/`.

### ✅ Sprint 10 — MCP Server Integration
- [x] Created `Scanner.ts` shared module with deterministic sorting, glob-based ignore patterns, and repository scan aggregation.
- [x] Implemented MCP Server (`src/mcp.ts`) with stdio transport: `review_file`, `review_repository`, `run_benchmark` tools.
- [x] Rich tool descriptions optimized for AI agent discovery (Cursor, Claude Desktop, Antigravity).
- [x] Dynamic version reading from `package.json`.
- [x] Refactored `cli.ts` to use shared `Scanner` module (code deduplication).
- [x] Fixed `globToRegex` placeholder bug across `Scanner` and `DiffDetector`.

### ✅ Sprint 11 — Real Repository Validation
- **Objective**: Run QA Brain on 10+ open-source Playwright repos and measure real-world Precision/Recall.
- **Status**: Completed.
- [x] Created validation workspace under `validation/`.
- [x] Added `ValidationRunner` for repository selection checks, rule coverage, review time, and finding triage reports.
- [x] Added `qa-brain validate [config]` CLI command and `npm run validate` script.
- [x] Selected and cloned 10 open-source Playwright repositories locally for the initial validation run.
- [x] Generated initial Rule Only validation report: 10 repositories, 226 files reviewed, 59 findings, 13 rule coverage entries.
- [x] Calibrated noisy assertion/isolation heuristics and reduced findings from 59 to 26 while keeping benchmark suite green.
- [x] Added framework/demo path-aware Missing Assertion filtering and reduced findings from 26 to 5 while keeping benchmark suite green.
- [x] Flagged no-spec repositories as excluded from active validation coverage.
- [x] Completed manual triage for the final 5 findings: 2 true positives, 2 observation candidates, 1 rule improvement candidate, 0 clear false positives.
- [x] Added benchmark cases for fixture-heavy reset flows and DB/API-adjacent tests without result assertions.
- [x] Downgraded demo/example missing assertion signals and reduced active findings from 5 to 2.
- [x] Converted final triage outcomes into benchmarks, rule improvement backlog, or documented justification.
- [x] Replaced no-spec small repository with `microsoft/playwright-mcp`; final validation covers 10 repositories and 229 files.
- [x] Published final Sprint 11 validation report and v0.9 RC recommendation.

Follow-up after Sprint 11:
- Add per-test-block assertion analysis instead of file-level assertion detection.
- Run LLM provider comparison after OpenAI/Gemini/Claude API usage is available.
