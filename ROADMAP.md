- [x] Added `qa-brain validate [config]` CLI command and `npm run validate` script.
- [x] Selected and cloned 10 open-source Playwright repositories locally for the initial validation run.
- [x] Generated initial Rule Only validation report: 10 repositories, 226 files reviewed, 59 findings, 13 rule coverage entries.
- [x] Calibrated noisy assertion/isolation heuristics and reduced findings from 59 to 26 while keeping benchmark suite green.
- [x] Added framework/demo path-aware Missing Assertion filtering and reduced findings from 26 to 5 while keeping benchmark suite green.
