## Future Roadmap

### ✅ Sprint 8 — CLI & Real Repository Scanning
- [x] CLI entry point (`src/cli.ts`) with `review`, `benchmark`, `--help`, `--version`, `--verbose`, `--format`, `--output`, `--provider`, `--config` support.
- [x] Recursive directory scanning with progress tracking and Repository Summary output.
- [x] Exit Code 1 on critical/high findings for CI/CD compatibility.
- [x] TypeScript compilation to `dist/` and global `npm link` registration.
- [x] Professional `README.md` with CLI usage guide, architecture diagram, and benchmark results.

### ✅ Sprint 9 — GitHub Action Integration
- [x] Implemented GitHub Action entry point (`src/action.ts`) utilizing dynamic imports for CommonJS compatibility.
- [x] Created `DiffDetector` with custom glob-to-regex ignore support (`**/generated/**`) to filter changed test files.
- [x] Designed `PRCommentFormatter` supporting PR summaries, detailed findings list, and GitHub Step Summaries.
- [x] Packaged with branding, inputs (max-files, ignore), and outputs in `action.yml`.
- [x] Added automated integration tests under `tests/action-integration/`.

### ⬜ Sprint 10 — MCP Server
- **Objective**: Implement Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide native integrations for Claude Desktop, VS Code, Cursor, and Antigravity.

### ⬜ v1.0 — Stable Release
- **Objective**: Reach production stability and expand rule sets to support multiple frameworks (Cypress, Selenium).
