# QA Cortex

> Repository-aware, rule-driven QA review engine for test automation projects.

**Status**: v0.1.3 - CLI, GitHub Action, MCP, and VS Code Marketplace client available.

> QA Cortex was previously developed under the QA Brain name. Some package names, command names, Marketplace identifiers, and repository URLs may temporarily retain `qa-brain` for compatibility.

## What is QA Cortex?

QA Cortex analyzes test automation projects and generates structured quality reports. It combines repository context, curated QA knowledge, deterministic local rules, and optional Gemini review output.

When `GEMINI_API_KEY` is available, QA Cortex asks Gemini to review the selected test against routed rule files. Without an API key, it runs a local deterministic rule review for common issues such as brittle selectors, hardcoded waits, shared state, and missing assertions.

### Key Features

- **Repository-aware analysis**: Reads `package.json`, `playwright.config.ts`, Page Objects, and custom fixtures before review.
- **Signal-based knowledge routing**: Loads only the rule files relevant to the target spec.
- **Deterministic scoring**: Quality, risk, and maintainability scores are calculated from findings and context.
- **Evidence-based findings**: Findings include code evidence and concrete recommendations.
- **Benchmark suite**: Built-in calibration runner with ground-truth JSON files.
- **GitHub Action support**: Reviews changed PR test files, or a configured `review-path`.
- **MCP server support**: Exposes file, repository, and benchmark review tools over stdio.
- **VS Code client**: Published VS Code extension for Problems panel diagnostics, Output reports, Status Bar, CodeLens, and dashboard workflows.

### Framework Support

| Framework / Language | Support Level | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Playwright TypeScript/JavaScript | Supported | Review, scoring, benchmark, validation, CLI, MCP, GitHub Action, and VS Code workflows. |
| Selenium WebDriver for Node.js | Preview/Foundation | Adapter and seed benchmarks exist; broader calibration continues. |
| Python test projects | Discovery-only | Scanner detects Python tests, dependencies, fixtures, and POM structures, but Python review/scoring is intentionally disabled for now. |

## Installation

### VS Code Marketplace

Install the VS Code client from Marketplace:

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qa-brain.qa-brain-vscode-client

### Local CLI / Core

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ridvan-byr/qa-brain.git
cd qa-brain
npm install
npm run build
```

Optional global link:

```bash
npm link
```

---

## CLI Usage

Review a single file:

```bash
qa-brain review tests/login.spec.ts
```

Review a directory:

```bash
qa-brain review tests/
```

Run with verbose diagnostics:

```bash
qa-brain review tests/ --verbose
```

Save JSON output:

```bash
qa-brain review tests/ --format json
```

Run benchmark calibration:

```bash
qa-brain benchmark
```

### CLI Options

| Option | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--help`, `-h` | Show usage guide | - |
| `--version`, `-v` | Show version number | - |
| `--verbose` | Print debug info such as routed rules and scores | `false` |
| `--format <type>` | Output format: `markdown` or `json` | `markdown` |
| `--output <dir>` | Directory to save reports | `reviews/` |
| `--provider <name>` | LLM provider. Currently only `gemini` is supported. | `gemini` |
| `--config <path>` | Path to `qa-brain.config.json` | - |

## GitHub Action

```yaml
name: QA Cortex

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: ridvan-byr/qa-brain@v0.1.0
        with:
          github-token: ${{ github.token }}
          gemini-api-key: ${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}
          max-files: '30'
```

If `review-path` is provided, the action scans that file or directory. Otherwise, it reviews changed `.spec.ts` and `.test.ts` files in the pull request.

## Benchmark

```bash
npm run build
qa-brain benchmark
```

The benchmark suite is useful for regression checks, but it is not a substitute for real repository validation. Real-world validation across open-source Playwright repositories is planned in Sprint 11.

## VS Code Client

QA Cortex is available as a VS Code extension:

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qa-brain.qa-brain-vscode-client

The extension source lives under `extensions/vscode`.

Build the root project first so the extension can reuse the compiled QA Cortex core:

```bash
npm run build
npx tsc -p extensions/vscode
```

Available commands:

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `QA Cortex: Review Current Test File` | Reviews the active `.spec` / `.test` file. |
| `QA Cortex: Review Selection` | Reviews the selected test block. |
| `QA Cortex: Review Changed Files` | Reviews changed Playwright test files from git diff. |
| `QA Cortex: Open Latest Report` | Opens the latest Markdown report generated by the extension. |
| `QA Cortex: Clear Diagnostics` | Clears QA Cortex Problems panel diagnostics. |

Default configuration:

| Setting | Default |
| :--- | :--- |
| `qaBrain.reviewMode` | `rule-only` |
| `qaBrain.reviewOnSave` | `false` |
| `qaBrain.openReportAfterReview` | `false` |
| `qaBrain.showDiagnostics` | `true` |
| `qaBrain.showCodeLens` | `true` |
| `qaBrain.showStatusBar` | `true` |
| `qaBrain.telemetryEnabled` | `false` |

The VS Code client is designed to run in VS Code Extension Development Host on Windows, macOS, and Linux by relying on VS Code and Node path APIs rather than platform-specific shell behavior.

### Privacy & Telemetry

QA Cortex telemetry is strictly opt-in and disabled by default. When enabled, the VS Code client writes anonymized local telemetry events to extension storage for review, test design, crash, and feature usage events.

Telemetry never records file paths, repository URLs, source code, API keys, or secrets. Every event includes a schema version and the extension version for compatibility tracking.

## Validation Dataset

Sprint 11 validation was completed against 10 open-source Playwright repositories.

Latest local validation run:

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Repositories configured | 10 |
| Files reviewed | 229 |
| Findings generated | 2 |
| Average review time | 1ms |
| Rule coverage entries | 13 |
| LLM provider comparison | Deferred |
| Final active findings | 2 true positives |

Manual triage of the final 5 findings found 2 true positives, 2 observation candidates, 1 rule improvement candidate, and 0 clear false positives. Demo/example missing assertion signals were downgraded, leaving 2 active findings.

The latest generated report is available at `validation/reports/latest-validation-report.md`.
Manual triage details are available at `validation/reports/manual-triage-report.md`.
Sprint 11 final report is available at `validation/reports/sprint-11-final-report.md`.
