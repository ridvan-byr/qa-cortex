# QA Brain

> Repository-aware, rule-driven, deterministic AI code review engine for Playwright test automation.

**Status**: v0.1.0 — CLI Ready 🚀

## What is QA Brain?

QA Brain is an AI-powered review engine that analyzes your Playwright test suites and generates structured, evidence-based quality reports. It combines a curated knowledge base of best practices with deterministic scoring algorithms to deliver consistent, explainable code review results.

### Key Features

- **Repository-Aware Analysis**: Scans `package.json`, `playwright.config.ts`, Page Objects, and custom fixtures to build full project context before review.
- **Signal-Based Knowledge Routing**: Only loads relevant review rules for each file, reducing token usage and improving accuracy.
- **Deterministic Scoring**: Quality, Risk, and Maintainability scores are computed mathematically — not by LLM opinion.
- **Evidence-Based Findings**: Every finding includes the exact code snippet and a concrete recommendation.
- **Benchmark Suite**: Built-in calibration runner with Ground Truth JSON files to measure Precision and Recall.

## Benchmark Results (Preliminary)

> **Note:** These results are from the built-in calibration suite (5 ground-truth specs). Real-world validation across open-source repositories is planned in Sprint 11.

Run `qa-brain benchmark` to execute the calibration suite:

```
==========================================
Passed: 5
Failed: 0
Precision: 100.0%  (5/5 ground-truth specs)
Recall: 100.0%     (5/5 ground-truth specs)
Average Review Time: 2.6ms
==========================================

Category Summary:
- Locator Rules: 2/2 Passed
- Waiting Rules: 1/1 Passed
- POM Rules: 1/1 Passed
- Fixture Rules: 1/1 Passed
```
