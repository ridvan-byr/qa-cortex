## Findings Requiring Triage

### F1: Missing Assertion

- Repository: synpress-io/synpress
- File: wallets/metamask/test/playwright/e2e/resetAccount.spec.ts
- Severity: Medium
- Evidence: `test('reset the account', async ({ context, metamaskPage }) => {`
- Recommendation: Add an assertion for the expected UI state, navigation, response, or persisted data after the action.
- Triage: TBD
- Action: New benchmark / Rule improvement / Documented justification

### F2: Missing Assertion

- Repository: antiwork/shortest
- File: packages/shortest/src/core/runner/test-case.ts
- Severity: Medium
- Evidence: `C:\tmp\qa-brain-validation-repos\shortest\packages\shortest\src\core\runner\test-case.ts`
- Recommendation: Add an assertion for the expected UI state, navigation, response, or persisted data after the action.
- Triage: TBD
- Action: New benchmark / Rule improvement / Documented justification

### F3: Missing Assertion

- Repository: antiwork/shortest
- File: packages/shortest/tests/e2e/test-ai.ts
- Severity: Medium
- Evidence: `C:\tmp\qa-brain-validation-repos\shortest\packages\shortest\tests\e2e\test-ai.ts`
- Recommendation: Add an assertion for the expected UI state, navigation, response, or persisted data after the action.
- Triage: TBD
- Action: New benchmark / Rule improvement / Documented justification

### F4: Missing Assertion

- Repository: antiwork/shortest
- File: packages/shortest/tests/e2e/test-browser.ts
- Severity: Medium
- Evidence: `C:\tmp\qa-brain-validation-repos\shortest\packages\shortest\tests\e2e\test-browser.ts`
- Recommendation: Add an assertion for the expected UI state, navigation, response, or persisted data after the action.
- Triage: TBD
- Action: New benchmark / Rule improvement / Documented justification

### F5: Missing Assertion

- Repository: antiwork/shortest
- File: packages/shortest/tests/e2e/test-email-rendering.ts
- Severity: Medium
- Evidence: `C:\tmp\qa-brain-validation-repos\shortest\packages\shortest\tests\e2e\test-email-rendering.ts`
- Recommendation: Add an assertion for the expected UI state, navigation, response, or persisted data after the action.
- Triage: TBD
- Action: New benchmark / Rule improvement / Documented justification

### F6: Redundant Hardcoded Timeout (waitForTimeout)

- Repository: antiwork/shortest
- File: packages/shortest/tests/e2e/test-github-login.ts
- Severity: High
- Evidence: `await newPage.waitForTimeout(2000);`
- Recommendation: Remove hardcoded wait and rely on Playwright auto-waiting assertions.
- Triage: TBD
- Action: New benchmark / Rule improvement / Documented justification

### F7: Missing Assertion

- Repository: antiwork/shortest
- File: packages/shortest/tests/e2e/test-helpers.ts
- Severity: Medium
- Evidence: `C:\tmp\qa-brain-validation-repos\shortest\packages\shortest\tests\e2e\test-helpers.ts`
- Recommendation: Add an assertion for the expected UI state, navigation, response, or persisted data after the action.
- Triage: TBD
- Action: New benchmark / Rule improvement / Documented justification

### F8: Missing Assertion

- Repository: antiwork/shortest
- File: packages/shortest/tests/e2e/test-keyboard.ts
- Severity: Medium
- Evidence: `C:\tmp\qa-brain-validation-repos\shortest\packages\shortest\tests\e2e\test-keyboard.ts`
- Recommendation: Add an assertion for the expected UI state, navigation, response, or persisted data after the action.
- Triage: TBD
- Action: New benchmark / Rule improvement / Documented justification

### F9: Missing Assertion

- Repository: antiwork/shortest
- File: packages/shortest/tests/e2e/test-loop.ts
- Severity: Medium
- Evidence: `C:\tmp\qa-brain-validation-repos\shortest\packages\shortest\tests\e2e\test-loop.ts`
- Recommendation: Add an assertion for the expected UI state, navigation, response, or persisted data after the action.
- Triage: TBD
- Action: New benchmark / Rule improvement / Documented justification

### F10: Missing Assertion

- Repository: akshayp7/playwright-typescript-playwright-test
- File: tests/db/DB.test.ts
- Severity: Medium
- Evidence: `test('Connect to Postgres DB', async () => {`
- Recommendation: Add an assertion for the expected UI state, navigation, response, or persisted data after the action.
- Triage: TBD
- Action: New benchmark / Rule improvement / Documented justification

## False Positive / False Negative Learning

Every false positive and false negative must produce one of: new benchmark, rule improvement, or documented justification.
