## Findings Requiring Triage

### F1: Missing Assertion

- Repository: synpress-io/synpress
- File: wallets/metamask/test/playwright/e2e/resetAccount.spec.ts
- Severity: Medium
- Evidence: `test('reset the account', async ({ context, metamaskPage }) => {`
- Recommendation: Add an assertion for the expected UI state, navigation, response, or persisted data after the action.
- Triage: TBD
- Action: New benchmark / Rule improvement / Documented justification

### F2: Missing Assertion

- Repository: akshayp7/playwright-typescript-playwright-test
- File: tests/db/DB.test.ts
- Severity: Medium
- Evidence: `test('Connect to Postgres DB', async () => {`
- Recommendation: Add an assertion for the expected UI state, navigation, response, or persisted data after the action.
- Triage: TBD
- Action: New benchmark / Rule improvement / Documented justification

## False Positive / False Negative Learning

Every false positive and false negative must produce one of: new benchmark, rule improvement, or documented justification.
