# QA Cortex Architecture

## Purpose

QA Cortex is an AI-powered Quality Engineering knowledge engine designed to analyze software tests, identify quality gaps, evaluate coverage, and recommend missing test scenarios using structured QA knowledge.

Unlike a traditional AI prompt, QA Cortex follows a reasoning process based on industry standards such as:

- ISTQB
- Microsoft Testing Playbook
- Google Testing Practices
- OWASP Testing Guide
- Unicode Standard
- W3C Internationalization

# Core Components

## Feature Detection

Identifies what functionality is being tested.

Examples:

- Login
- Search
- Registration
- File Upload
- Checkout
- API Endpoint

---

## Risk Assessment

Determines the business and technical risk level.

Possible levels:

- Critical
- High
- Medium
- Low

---

## Knowledge Routing

Selects only the relevant knowledge modules instead of searching the entire knowledge base.

Example:

Login →

- Authentication
- Boundary Value Analysis
- Unicode
- Session Testing
- OWASP Authentication

---

## QA Reasoning Engine

Combines all selected knowledge and evaluates the test.

The reasoning engine never reviews code randomly.

Instead, it follows predefined QA principles.

---

## Coverage Evaluation

Measures how completely a feature is tested.

Coverage is evaluated using multiple QA dimensions instead of line coverage.

Example dimensions:

- Happy Path
- Negative Testing
- Boundary Testing
- Edge Cases
- Unicode
- Security
- Accessibility
- Assertions

---

## Recommendation Engine

Generates actionable recommendations.

Examples:

- Missing boundary tests
- Missing Unicode validation
- Missing authorization tests
- Weak assertions
- Duplicate scenarios

---

# Design Principles

QA Cortex should always:

- Reason before answering
- Use structured QA knowledge
- Avoid assumptions
- Explain recommendations
- Produce deterministic reviews whenever possible---
