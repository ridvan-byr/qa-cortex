# Orchestration Layer

The Orchestration Layer coordinates how QA Cortex loads knowledge, applies review rules, resolves conflicts, and generates deterministic review results.

It acts as the execution planner of QA Cortex.

Instead of evaluating every available rule, QA Cortex dynamically selects the most relevant knowledge based on the detected framework, feature, component, and risk level.
