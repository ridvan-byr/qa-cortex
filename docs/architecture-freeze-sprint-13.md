# Sprint 13 Architecture Freeze Report

Generated: 2026-07-04

## Scope

This milestone validates the Sprint 13A/13B adapter and signal architecture before starting Selenium implementation.

No new product feature was added during this milestone.

## Checks

| Check | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| Working tree clean before freeze | Passed |
| Router dependency review | Passed |
| Framework knowledge ownership review | Passed |
| `npm run build` | Passed |
| `npm test` | Passed |
| Benchmark suite | 7/7 passed |
| Benchmark regression | None |
| Sprint 11 validation smoke | Passed |
| VS Code Client compile smoke | Passed |

## Findings

### FZ-1: Duplicate Knowledge Mapping Risk

Sprint 13B left Playwright knowledge file mapping in both router-facing rule mapping and `PlaywrightAdapter.knowledgeProfile()`.

Action taken:

- Added `src/framework/KnowledgeProfiles.ts` as the framework-owned source for Playwright base knowledge and routing knowledge files.
- Updated `KnowledgeRouter` to request base/routed knowledge from the framework profile helper.
- Updated `PlaywrightAdapter.knowledgeProfile()` to use the same helper.
- Kept `src/router/RuleMapping.ts` as a compatibility re-export.

### FZ-2: Router Should Not Own Playwright Knowledge Paths

`KnowledgeRouter` still needs to know the target framework, but should not directly own Playwright-specific knowledge path lists.

Action taken:

- Removed direct Playwright knowledge path ownership from `KnowledgeRouter`.
- Playwright knowledge paths now live under `src/framework/KnowledgeProfiles.ts`.

## Validation Result

Latest validation smoke:

| Metric | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| Repositories configured | 10 |
| Files reviewed | 229 |
| Findings | 2 |
| Average review time | 1ms |
| Provider comparison | Skipped |

## Decision

Architecture Freeze passed.

QA Cortex is ready to start Sprint 13C - Selenium WebDriver Adapter.

## Follow-Up

- Remove the compatibility re-export `src/router/RuleMapping.ts` in a future cleanup once imports settle.
- Keep framework knowledge ownership inside the framework/profile layer.
- Avoid adding Selenium logic directly into `KnowledgeRouter`.
