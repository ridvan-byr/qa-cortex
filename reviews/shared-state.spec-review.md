# QA Cortex Review Report

## Summary

Review for test isolation shared state.

---

## Findings

### Finding: Test İzolasyonu İhlali (Shared State)
- **Description**: Global mutable variables are mutated across tests, preventing parallel runs.
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Confidence**: 100% (let globalUserId defined outside)
- **Evidence**:
  ```typescript
  let globalUserId = '';
  ```
- **Recommendation**: Isolate test state by logging in via isolated custom fixtures
