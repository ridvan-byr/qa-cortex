# QA Cortex Review Report

## Summary

Review for dashboard test with hardcoded waits.

---

## Findings

### Finding: Redundant Hardcoded Timeout (waitForTimeout)
- **Description**: The test uses page.waitForTimeout(5000) for page loading, causing flakiness.
- **Severity**: High
- **Confidence**: 95% (waitForTimeout call matched)
- **Evidence**:
  ```typescript
  await page.waitForTimeout(5000);
  ```
- **Recommendation**: Remove hardcoded wait and rely on Playwright auto-waiting assertions.
